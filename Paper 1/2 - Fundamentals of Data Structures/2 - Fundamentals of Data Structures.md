## Arrays

An *array* is a fixed-size collection of values, all of the same data type. Each element is given an index, which can start with either 0 or 1.

Arrays can be created in multiple dimensions, for example to represent tabular data.

## Fields, records and files

Information is stored on computers as a series of *files*. Each file is made up of *records* which are composed of a number of *fields*.
