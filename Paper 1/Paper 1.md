### Trace tables

Trace tables are used to keep track of the state of a program throughouts its execution.

In AQA, make sure to create a new row in the trace table when:
- Variables are initialised for the first time
- A print or output statement is encountered
- The end of a loop is reached
- The end of the program is reached

In each row, if the value of a variable has not changed then leave its cell blank.
