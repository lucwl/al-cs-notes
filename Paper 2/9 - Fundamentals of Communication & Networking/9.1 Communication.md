# Communication

It is important to understand some basic concepts of communication.

A *symbol* is a particular pattern of bits represented by a signal. For example, a symbol of bits may be represented as *0010*.

*Baud rate* represents the number of signal changes in the medium per second. 1 Baud (1 Bd) represents 1 symbol change per second.

*Bit rate* represents the number of bits that are transmitted over the medium in a second.
It is calculated with:

bit rate  $=$  baud rate $\times$ bits per symbol

Bit rate will be higher than baud rate if there is more than one bit sent per signal.
