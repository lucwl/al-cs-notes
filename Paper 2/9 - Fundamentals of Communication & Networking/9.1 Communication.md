# Communication

It is important to understand some basic concepts of communication.

A *symbol* is a particular pattern of bits represented by a signal. For example, a symbol of bits may be represented as *0010*.

*Baud rate* represents the number of signal changes in the medium per second. 1 Baud (1 Bd) represents 1 symbol change per second. In other words, how many times the signal alters its state in a second.

*Bit rate* represents the number of bits that are transmitted over the medium in a second. A single signal change can represent more than one bit.

It is calculated with:

bit rate  $=$  baud rate $\times$ bits per symbol

Bit rate will be higher than baud rate if there is more than one bit sent per signal.

*Bandwidth*, measured in Hertz, represents the range of frequencies that a communication medium is capable of transmitting. Higher bandwidth results in a higher bitrate.

*Latency* in a computer network is the difference in time between an action being initiated and its effect being noticed. It increases with distance.

A *protocol* is a set of communication rules between two devices. These are often decided by international organisations which allow devices made by two different manufacturers in opposite ends of the world to communicate seamlessly.

### Serial and parallel transmission

There are two types of digital communication: *serial* and *parallel*, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. 

#### Serial transmission

In serial data transmission, data is sent *one bit at a time* over a communication line.
- Usually a copper wire
- May also be a fibre optic cable or a wireless channel

Since only one bit is sent at a time, a high and low voltage is used.

Serial transmission is frequently used for sending data from medium to long distances, such as from wired peripherals like mice and keyboards to computers.

#### Parallel transmission

In parallel data transmission, multiple parallel communication lines are used to send multiple bits simultaneously over one channel. The more lines that a parallel communication medium uses, the more data can be transferred.

Often 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits are sent at the same time.>
