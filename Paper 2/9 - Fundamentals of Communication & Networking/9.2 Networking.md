# Networking

A *network* is a group of devices connected together, wirelessly or using cables, so that they can communicate with each other and share resources. There are different ways networks can be structured and categorised.

*Topology* refers to the structure of a network.

There are two types of topology to consider: *physical* and *logical*.

## Physical topology

Physical network topology is the actual structure of the network, how it is organised in hardware. Networks using one physical topology will interconnect components differently to how a network of another physical topology will.

There are several types of physical network topology, but the only two you are expected to learn are *star* and *bus*.

#### Physical star network topology

In a physical star network,
