# Networking

A *network* is a group of devices connected together, wirelessly or using cables, so that they can communicate with each other and share resources. There are different ways networks can be structured and categorised.

*Topology* refers to the structure of a network.

There are two types of topology to consider: *physical* and *logical*.

## Physical topology

Physical network topology is the actual structure of the network, how it is organised in hardware. Networks using one physical topology will interconnect components differently to how a network of another physical topology will.

There are several types of physical network topology, but the only two you are expected to learn are *star* and *bus*.

#### Physical star network topology

In a physical star network, each client (device connected to the hub) has its own direct connection to the central hub. The hub receives packets for all the clients connected to it and is responsible for delivering them to the correct recipient.

A server can be added to the network in the same way that clients are connected to the central hub.

| **Advantages**                                                                                                                | **Disadvantages**                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Packets are sent directly to their recipient, other devices in the network cannot see packets that were not intended for them | Should all the central hub fail, all communication over the network is stopped |
| It is easy to add and remove clients from the network                                                                         | Relatively expensive to install due to large amount of cablijng                |
