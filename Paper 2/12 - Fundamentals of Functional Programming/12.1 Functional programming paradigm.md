# Functional programming paradigm

According to Wikipedia: functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

## Functions

According to AQA:

> *a function is a rule that, for each element in some set A of inputs, assigns an output chosen from set B, but without necessarily using every member of B* 

An *argument* (a piece of data) is passed to a function, causing a rule to be applied to the input, creating the return value (the output).

The input or output could even be another function. This called using *higher-order functions*.

## Function types

All functions have a *function type*. This describes the set of inputs and outputs that the function maps to. 

For example:

$\Large{f: \\ A \to B}$

$A$ is known as the argument type, while $B$ is known as the result type. This means the function $f$ maps $A$ to $B$. The set of inputs is known as the *domain*, while the set of outputs is known as the *co-domain*. Not all members of the codomain have to be used as outputs.
