# Functional programming paradigm

According to Wikipedia: functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

## Functions

According to AQA:

> *a function is a rule that, for each element in some set A of inputs, assigns an output chosen from set B, but without necessarily using every member of B*
